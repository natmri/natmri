   *
   * If you need to transfer a `MessagePort` to the main process, use

   *
   * If you do not need a response to the message, consider using `ipcRenderer.send`.

   * > **Note** Sending non-standard JavaScript types such as DOM objects or special
   * Electron objects will throw an exception.
   *
   * Since the main process does not have support for DOM objects such as
   * `ImageBitmap`, `File`, `DOMMatrix` and so on, such objects cannot be sent over
   * Electron's IPC to the main process, as the main process would have no way to
   * decode them. Attempting to send such objects over IPC will result in an error.
   *
   * > **Note** If the handler in the main process throws an error, the promise
   * returned by `invoke` will reject. However, the `Error` object in the renderer
   * process will not be the same as the one thrown in the main process.
